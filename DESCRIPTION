Description: Computationally efficient tools for comparing all pairs of profiles
    in a DNA database. The expectation and covariance of the summary statistic
    is implemented for fast computing. Routines for estimating proportions of
    close related individuals are available. The use of wildcards (also called F-
    designation) is implemented. Dedicated functions ease plotting the results. 
    See Tvedebrink et al. (2012) <doi:10.1016/j.fsigen.2011.08.001>. 
    Compute the distribution of the numbers of alleles in DNA mixtures.
